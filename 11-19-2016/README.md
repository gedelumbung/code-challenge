1. Make a variable called "full_name" that contains your full name.

2. Create a function called "orderize" which RETURN an array of all characters in variable full_name. They should be inside an array (lowercased, no space) and are in ascending order form A to Z. 
Ex: Say your name is Arigi, the return of the function would be ["a","g","i","i","r"] 

3. Create a function called "distinguish" that RETURN an array contains a unique, ascendingly ordered string of all your full name characters. 
Ex: your name is "Arigi", the result of this function should be "agir" 

4. Make a variable called "reversed" which contains the reverse of the third instruction. 

5. Make an object variable called "characters" which has properties named "vocals" and "consonants". As the variable named, "vocals" should contain string of unique vocal of your name. "consonants" will contain string of unique consonant of your name.
